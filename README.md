# 42_pipex
The aim of this project is to understand how pipes and redirections works. To do that, the program must receive file names and commands as arguments and execute it in a certain order.

To call the program, you should type:

`./pipex <infile> <cmd1> <cmd2> <outfile>`

This should work the same way as the following shell command:

`< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`

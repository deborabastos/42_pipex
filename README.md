# 42_pipex
The aim of this project is to understand how pipes and redirections works. To do that, the program must receive file names and commands as arguments and execute it as follows:
`./pipex <infile> <cmd1> <cmd2> <outfile>`

The program should work the same way as the following shell command:
`< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile`
